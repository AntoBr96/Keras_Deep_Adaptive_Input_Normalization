# Keras/Tensorflow implementation of the Deep Adaptive Input Normalization layer for Time Series Forecasting

This notebook contains the Keras/Tensorflow Layer implementation of the Deep Adaptive Input Normalization model  for Time Series Forecasting proposed by Passalis *et al.* ([Deep Adaptive Input Normalization for Time series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07892.pdf)).

The authors of the above mentioned paper propose a PyTorch implementation ([PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/passalis/dain)) of the model. A slightly reviewed version (software structure) is here reported. Results obtained by the two implementations are compared through an explicative example.
